# Team CHAMPS! first UXE class project
------

This is the main repository of the UXE class project for Team CHAMPS!

## Project summary
------

We are creating a prototype of a web app used for consolidating wishlists with a personal calendar for reminding a significant other of gift ideas for important upcoming holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, etc.

We are starting from a mobile perspective, writing responsive HTML and CSS, and adding Jquery/JavaScript and CSS animation after finishing the barebones HTML and CSS.
